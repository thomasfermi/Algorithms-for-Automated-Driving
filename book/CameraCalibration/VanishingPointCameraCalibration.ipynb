    "Sensor calibration is one of the most important aspects of building a robot. Different sensors have differnt callibration procedures. For this chapter, we would be focusing on extrinsic camera calibration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Refer back to the ['From Pixels to Meters'](https://thomasfermi.github.io/Algorithms-for-Automated-Driving/LaneDetection/InversePerspectiveMapping.html) chapter. If you did the excersices of that chapter, you may recall that to covert the lane line pixels detected by the neural network to meters, the rotation matrix $\\mathbf{R_{cr}}$ was required that described how the camera was oriented with respect to the road. $\\mathbf{R_{cr}}$ was very easy to obtain through the CARLA simulator. But this may not be that easy in real life to obtain $\\mathbf{R_{cr}}$. The road is also not flat in real life mostly as the road can be banked, elevated or just uneven and therefore, the orientaion of the car and the camera keeps changing with respect to the flat road frame. The orientation of car and camera may also change with respect to the road if car breaks are hit hard or due to the car suspension. "
