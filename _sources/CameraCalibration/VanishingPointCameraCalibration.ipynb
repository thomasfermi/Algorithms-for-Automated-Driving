    "# Extrinsic Camera Calibration \n",
    "\n",
    "Sensor calibration is one of the most important aspects of building a robot. Different sensors have different calibration procedures. Typically one can distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. Intrinsic camera calibration tries to estimate the camera matrix $K$ (and potentially other camera-specific parameters like distortion coefficients). You can learn more about it in this [lecture by Cyril Stachniss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou9Uj75DJX0), and this [OpenCV python tutorial](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.2/dc/dbb/tutorial_py_calibration.html). For this chapter, we will be focusing on extrinsic camera calibration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Refer back to the [From Pixels to meters chapter](../LaneDetection/InversePerspectiveMapping.ipynb). If you did the exercises of that chapter, you may recall that to convert the lane line pixels detected by the neural network to meters, you needed the camera height $h$ and the rotation matrix $\\mathbf{R_{cr}}$, which describes how the camera is oriented with respect to the road reference frame. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Reminder: Road reference frame\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "The \"road reference frame\" was defined in [the chapter on camera basics](../LaneDetection/CameraBasics.ipynb), and it is attached to the vehicle.  The $Z$ direction in the road reference frame is always identical to the vehicle's forwards axis and the $Y$ axis is identical to the vehicle's \"downwards axis\". The name \"road reference frame\" could be a bit misleading. The only reason we used the word \"road\" for this reference frame, is because the $Z-X$-plane in this reference frame is identical to the road plane, which we approximate as flat.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{R_{cr}}$ was very easy to obtain through the CARLA simulator. But this is not that easy in real life. When you mount the camera to your vehicle, you can try to make it perfectly straight, which would correspond to $\\mathbf{R_{cr}} = \\mathbf{1}$, but you will always make a small mistake, which makes calibration necessary. The orientation with respect to the road could also change dynamically, which makes calibration challenging: \n",
    "The road is not always flat. It can be banked, elevated or just uneven and therefore, the orientation of the car and the camera keeps changing with respect to the flat road frame. The orientation of the car and the camera may also change with respect to the road if the car breaks are hit hard or due to the car suspension. "

    "Proper extrinsic calibration is essential for good vehicle control. The following plot shows two simulations in which the camera was mounted with a yaw of 4 degrees and a pitch of -4 degrees. In the first simulation, these yaw and pitch values were passed correctly to the `CameraGeometry` object, which was implemented in the chapter on Lane Detection. Hence, in this first simulation the calibraton was *perfect*. In the second simulation, default values of zero degrees were incorrectly assumed for both pitch and yaw. Hence, there was no calibration at all. "

    "As you can see in the plot, having no calibration at all makes the vehicle leave the center of the lane until it has a constant offset of around 40 cm from the middle of the lane. Why does this happen? The wrong yaw and pitch values lead to the computation of a wrong reference path, which is then passed to the controller.  In case of *perfect calibration* the results looks different. Here, the vehicle stays in the middle of the lane within an error of around 5 cm (except for one small disturbance at around 4 seconds which is due to a bad detection of the neural network).\n",
