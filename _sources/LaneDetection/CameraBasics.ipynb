One photosensor only receives light through a blue filter, one only through a red filter, and two receive light through a green filter.

We can convert a **Euclidean vector** $(u,v)^T$ into a **homogeneous vector** by appending a $1$ to obtain $(u,v,1)^T$. If we multiply a homogeneous vector by a nonzero real number $\\lambda$, it is considered to still represent the same mathematical object. In other words $(u,v,1)^T$ and $\\lambda (u,v,1)^T$ are the \"same\" homogeneous vector, they are *equivalent*. Similarly $(2,3,7)^T$ and $(4,6,14)$ are equivalent. To express that two homogeneous vectors $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ are equivalent we write $\\lambda \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{w}$, often without exactly specifying what value $\\lambda$ has. Typically, we want to represent a homogeneous vector in its canonical form, for which the last entry is $1$. The canonical form of $(2,3,7)^T$ is $(2/7, 3/7, 1)^T$. To go from a homogeneous vector back to a Euclidean vector, we first bringt it to canonical form, and then take all but the last vector components. In our example this would be $(2/7,3/7)^T$. Note that we can do the same procedure to construct a homogeneous vector with four components by appending a $1$ to a three dimensional Euclidean vector. You might think that this procedure is quite strange, but soon you will see the usefulness of homogeneous coordinates.\n",

    "Note that the form of these matrices depends on the coordinate system. We chose the $(X_d, Y_d, Z_d)^T$ frame here. In the $(X_i, Y_i, Z_i)^T$ frame the matrices would look a bit different, since for example the \"forwards\" direction in the $(X_i, Y_i, Z_i)^T$ frame is $(1,0,0)^T$, whereas it is $(0,0,1)^T$ in the default camera frame $(X_d, Y_d, Z_d)^T$. So if you find a differently looking roll matrix in some book, this probably has to do with the naming of the axes. What all books tend to agree on: In the case of vehicles (like cars or planes), the roll axis points forwards, the yaw axis upwards (or downwards), and the pitch axis to the right (or left).\n"
